    <h1>Chapter 1: DATABASE</h1>
    <p>With this chapter, we are going to explain MySQL commands used in our system to build tables, create relationships between tables, and manipulate data as we can view, insert, update, and delete.</p>
    <p>In our database, we need to explain table-to-table by defining its role in building cohesion while the system is running accordingly.</p>
    <p>Let us go through our database as we are using xampp server version 127.0.0.1</p>
    <h2>1.1 SECTION 1:</h2>
    <h3>1.1.1 ENTITIES</h3>
    <p>Our system has 8 entities including admin entity, that we are going to describe one by one according to their relationships;</p>
